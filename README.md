### TODO
* handle screen resizes. Reset the scroller mesaurements.
* instead of clipping items that create an odd ending, duplicate the items until there is no longer an odd ending.
    * This will also create a need for an update to the redraw method.
* Documentation for how to use and what the defaults are.
* Namespacing of methods
* Build as a plugin
